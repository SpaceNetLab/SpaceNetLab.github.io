Rate control mechanisms are foundational to the performance of real-time communication (RTC) applications.

However, a number of practical challenges make it quite difficult to evaluate new ideas and algorithms in a reproducible manner. In this project we aim at presenting a system that address this issue by serving as a community testbed for researches on rate control of RTC applications. Ideally our platform allows network researchers to benefit from and contribute to a common set of benchmark algorithms, a shared evaluation platform and a public archive of results.
